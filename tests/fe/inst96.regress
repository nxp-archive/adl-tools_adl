Instruction Fields:
  OPCD: [0,5] 
    Primary opcode.
    
  RA: [11,15] [regfile:  GPR]
    Field used to specify a General Purpose Register to be used as a source.
    
  RB: [16,20] [regfile:  GPR]
    Field used to specify a General Purpose Register to be used as a source.
    
  RT: [6,10] [regfile:  GPR]
    Field used to specify a General Purpose Register to be used as a target.
    
  XO: [21,30] 
    Extended opcode.
    
Instructions:
  Name:  add (rank: 100)
  Width:  32
  Fields:  OPCD(31) RT RA RB XO(266)
  Action:  {
    GPR ( RT ) = GPR ( RA ) + 2 * GPR ( RB ) ;
}
  Source Registers:  GPR(RA) GPR(RB) 
  Target Registers:  GPR(RT) 
  Documention:

The sum GPR(RA) + GPR(RB) is placed into RD.

The add instruction is preferred for additions because it sets few status bits.
