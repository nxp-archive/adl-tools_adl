# This is the linker target specific file.  This is invoked by the
# autoconf generated configure script.  Putting it in a separate shell
# file lets us skip running autoconf when modifying target specific
# information.

# This file switches on the shell variable ${targ}, and sets the
# following shell variables:
#  targ_emul		name of linker emulation to use
#  targ_extra_emuls	additional linker emulations to provide
#  targ_extra_libpath	additional linker emulations using LIB_PATH
#  targ_extra_ofiles	additional host-compiled objects needed by the emulation
#  targ64_extra_emuls	additional linker emulations to provide if
#  			--enable-64-bit-bfd is given or if host is 64 bit.
#  targ64_extra_libpath	additional linker emulations using LIB_PATH if
#  			--enable-64-bit-bfd is given or if host is 64 bit.
#  NATIVE_LIB_DIRS	library directories to search on this host
#			(if we are a native or sysrooted linker)
